## The Python Programming Language
- Python is an open-sourced, object-oriented, high-level programming language that has been becoming more and more popular in recent years.
- Python was first developed by Guido van Rossum in the early 1990s. It was named after the movies Monty Python.
- The language comes with numerous libraries and frameworks that facilitate high performance computing, whether it be software development, web development, data analysis, or machine learning
- Python is available for downloaded from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Concurrency in Python
- Concurrency, in the context of computer science and programming, denotes the act of processing multiple computation tasks in an overlapping manner, potentially independently from one another.
- Two of the biggest advantages of implementing concurrency in an application is the improvement in execution time and responsiveness. As multiple tasks are executed at the same time, it would take less time to execute the whole application and individual tasks would also finish faster.
- Concurrency is also different from parallelism in the sense that concurrent programming might involve coordination between different tasks, while parallel processing simply execute all tasks independently.
- Python provides extensive API and libraries to facilitate the three most common forms of concurrent programming: multithreading, multiprocessing, and asynchronous programming.

## Brief Introduction to _Mastering Concurrency in Python_

Mastering Concurrency in Python will serve as a comprehensive introduction to various advanced concepts in concurrent engineering and programming in Python. This book will also provide a detailed overview of how concurrency and parallelism are being used in real-world applications. It is a perfect blend of theoretical analyses and practical examples, which will give you a full understanding of the theories and techniques regarding concurrent programming in Python.

This book will be divided into six main sections. It will start with the idea behind concurrency and concurrent programming—the history, how it is being used in the industry today, and finally, a mathematical analysis of the speedup that concurrency can potentially provide.

The next three sections will cover three of the main implementation approaches in concurrent programming: threads, processes, and asynchronous I/O, respectively. These sections will include theoretical concepts and principles for each of these approaches, the syntax and various functionalities that the Python language provides to support them, discussions of best practices for their advanced usage, and hands-on projects that directly apply these concepts to solve real-world problems.

Section five will introduce readers to some of the most common problems that engineers and programmers face in concurrent programming: deadlock, starvation, and race conditions. Readers will learn about the theoretical foundations and causes for each problem, analyze and replicate each of them in Python, and finally implement potential solutions. The last chapter in this section will discuss the aforementioned GIL, which is specific to the Python language. It will cover the GIL's integral role in the Python ecosystem, some challenges that the GIL poses for concurrent programming, and how to implement effective workarounds.

In the last section of the book, we will be working on various advanced applications of concurrent Python programming. These applications will include the design of lock-free and lock-based concurrent data structures, memory models and operations on atomic types, and how to build a server that supports concurrent request processing from scratch. The section will also cover the the best practices when testing, debugging, and scheduling concurrent Python applications.

Throughout this book, you will be building essential skills for working with concurrent programs, just through following the discussions, the example code, and the hands-on projects. You will understand the fundamentals of the most important concepts in concurrent programming, how to implement them in Python programs, and how to apply that knowledge to advanced applications. By the end of _Mastering Concurrency in Python_, you will have a unique combination of extensive theoretical knowledge regarding concurrency, and practical know-how of the various applications of concurrency in the Python language.
