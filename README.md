# Mastering Concurrency in Python

## Introduction
This repository includes example and project code covered in _Mastering Concurrency
in Python_, a book written by me and published by Packt Publishing. (It is temporarily
in progress.)

More information on the book could be found [here]().


## Setting up
This repository includes all example and project code covered in the book.
To download the repository:
- Click on the green "Clone or download" button in the top right corner of your
window. Choose "Download ZIP" to download the compressed repository to your computer.
- Uncompress the downloaded file to create the folder that we are looking for.
The folder should have the name "Mastering-Concurrency-master"

Inside the folder are separate subfolders titled "chX," indicating the chapter
that covers the code in that subfolder. For example, the "ch3" subfolder contains
example and project code covered in Chapter 3. In each subfolder are various Python
scripts; as you go through each code example throughout the book, you will know
which script to run for a specific point in each chapter.
